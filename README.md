Click Sequence Grid

Introduction
Click Sequence Grid is an interactive React-based web application that allows users to click on a 3x3 grid. Each clicked cell changes color in the order of selection, and once the entire grid is filled, the cells are sequentially numbered based on the order in which they were clicked. The grid also displays a message when fully covered.

Features
Click on any white cell to change it to green.

Track the sequence of clicks.
Once all cells are clicked, they sequentially turn orange and display their order number.
Smooth UI with an attractive gradient background.

Fully responsive design.
How It Works
Initial State: The grid starts as a 3x3 matrix with all white cells.
Click Interaction: Clicking on a white cell changes its color to green and stores its coordinates.
Full Grid Behavior: When all 9 cells are clicked, the grid transitions to a sequential numbering system.
Sequential Animation: Each cell changes to an orange background with a number based on the order it was clicked, appearing with a delay of 500ms between each step.
Completion Message: Once the entire grid is numbered, a heading "Grid Fully Covered" is displayed.
